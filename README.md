# ðŸ§ ðŸ˜‚ Brainfuck Compiler ðŸ˜‚ðŸ§ 
:computer: Welcome to my BrainFuck compiler project! :nerd_face:
A small compiler written in C++ for the esoteric programming language brainfuck.

## ðŸ‘¾ðŸ˜‚ What is Brainfuck ðŸ˜‚ðŸ‘¾??



BrainFuck is an esoteric programming language that is known for its minimalist design and unconventional syntax. It is often used as a challenge for programmers to implement interpreters or compilers for the language.

This repository contains a BrainFuck compiler that I have written in C++. It is capable of taking BrainFuck code as input and producing an output of the equivalent program written in another programming language. :gear:

If you are interested in esoteric programming languages or the process of compiler design, I encourage you to take a look at this project. The code is well-documented and should be easy to understand even if you are new to BrainFuck or compiler design. :book:

I hope you find this project interesting and informative. :nerd_face: If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to leave a comment or submit a pull request. :point_down:

## Usage
1. Compile as a normal c++ program
```
./[program_name] [input_file]
```
